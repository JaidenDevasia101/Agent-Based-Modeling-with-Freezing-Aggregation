# <h1>Agent-Based-Modeling-with-Freezing-Aggregation</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project is an agent-based model using Java and Mason libraries that visualizes freezing aggregation, where if one agent comes into contact with another they both freeze in place. The project also includes a graph and display for easy visualization. Additionally, the project includes a convient GUI where you can you easily manipulate values in order to experiment with different number of agents, environment boundaries/shape, enviornment size, time intervals of movement and more.
